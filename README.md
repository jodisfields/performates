# Performates Frontend

This project consists of a frontend application built with React and Next.JS. The backend functionality is powered by Firebase.

## Frontend

The frontend includes a signup form for events, integrated with the Eventbrite API. It interfaces with Firebase for backend operations like user authentication and data storage.

## Backend

Firebase is used as the backend solution. It handles user authentication, data storage, and API interactions with Eventbrite for event management.

## Eventbrite API Integration

- Set your Eventbrite API key in a `.env` file in your project directory for secure access to the Eventbrite API.

## Setup

- Set up environment variables for both Firebase and Eventbrite API keys.
- Run `npm install` in the project directory to install dependencies.
- Use `npm start` to run the frontend application.

Note: Backend operations are managed through Firebase, so no separate backend server setup is required.
